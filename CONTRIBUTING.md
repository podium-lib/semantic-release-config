Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to Podium ❤️

You can find [the general contribution docs here](https://github.com/podium-lib/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This module is a [shared config for Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/shareable-configurations). We accept changes that should apply to all repositories in the [podium-lib origanisation](https://github.com/podium-lib).

A change in configuration is considered a `patch` in [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A new export would be a `minor`. Requiring a new major of `semantic-release` would be a `major`.
